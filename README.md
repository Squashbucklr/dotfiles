# Squashbucklr's Dotfiles

Mostly standard stuff. I like a clean layout, and I really like pywal.

The general model of the install.sh script is to symlink files out of this
repository and into the config locations. It also has support for automatically
symlinking pywal templates and generated configs correctly.
